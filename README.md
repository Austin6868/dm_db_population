# How to Use this Tool

## Getting it to Run
- Clone this repository or just download zip

- Once you are in the terminal under the same directory(assuming you already know how to run python and have pip installed), run:

  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Once you have modified the code based on your needs following the instructions in the code, run: 

  ```python fake_data_generator.py```

  OR

  ```python fake_data_generator.py```

  (whichever one works) Under the same directory.

## Additional Notes
- Faker is one of the most used tools in this code base, here are some [more advanced examples](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/fakerclass.html#examples) if you wanna consider them, but you can always chatGPT:)
